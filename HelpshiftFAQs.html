This allows us to prorate your final bill. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If you&#39;re a rideshare customer, your first weekly payment won&#39;t be due for 7 days from pickup, with your pickup date counting as the first billing day.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How are estimated monthly payments different than my actual pricing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our website&#39;s Preview Mode shows estimated monthly payments.

You can start the process by scanning your license. Simply pre-qualifying won&#39;t affect your credit score. Once you&rsquo;ve completed this process, it&rsquo;ll only take a few moments to find out your maximum monthly payment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How much is the late charge?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You may incur a late charge for any payment that is not received 10 days after your due date. That amount will be the lower of $25 or 5% of the amount due. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What if I can&#39;t afford my car anymore?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If you can no longer afford your car, you can simply return it anytime. We do just ask that you give us five days notice in order to for us to set the return pickup. Please remember, you&#39;ll still be due a final, prorated bill, as payments are due at the end of the period. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">My bank isn&#39;t listed when I try to connect an account.

Unlike traditional lenders, Fair will consider applicants with no previous credit history. &nbsp;We encourage you to pre-qualify in the app to see if you&rsquo;re eligible at this time. As we&#39;ll just do a soft credit check when you pre-qualify, it won&#39;t impact your credit score. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Do you allow cosigners?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At this time, we do not support adding a cosigner.
